Hi, I'm Dan, a Student Researcher from CUNY Lehman.
======
I am a dedicated Machine Learning engineer specializing in computer vision, currently collaborating with Professor Jason Hallstrom on the innovative Center for Smart StreetScapes (CS3) project. My role involves developing cutting-edge solutions to enhance urban environments through intelligent technology. As an NSF CS3 student council member, I actively participate in cross institutional collaborations, contributing to discussions and strategies with various schools. Passionate about pushing the boundaries of Al to create smarter, safer, and more sustainable cities, I am constantly exploring new challenges and opportunities in the field of machine learning.

I have been part of the CEAL lab at Columbia University where I also worked on CS3 projects. I am finishing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science with a Math minor at CUNY Lehman College in Fall 2024 and I'm applying for PhD positions.
