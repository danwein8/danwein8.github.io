I am a dedicated Machine Learning engineer specializing in Robotics (HRI), currently under the mentorship of Dr. Raj Korpan at CUNY Hunter for my PhD. I have worked with Dr. Jason Hallstrom and Dr. Brian Smith on the innovative Center for Smart StreetScapes (CS3) project. I am currently working on Multi-Agent Pathfinding.
